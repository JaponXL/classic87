Classic TKL Keyboard

My intent was to cnc it from wood, you will need to cut a plate using 1.5mm inox or steel, some 5mm M3 popnuts and some M3 screws.
The bottom is big enough for a battery if you want  to make a bluetooth keyboard.

PCB will come later when I have enough fund to make test board.

If you like the design, you can buy me a drink here: [Paypal](https://paypal.me/Keysekai)
